    <h2>Have your message seen by thousands of students at the University of Wisconsin.</h2>

    <p>
        We have several advertising options available in print and online that will help your message reach thousands of students and non-students in and around the UW Madison campus. Whether you're looking to recruit students to an open internship or job program, or you're looking to sell a product or service, we will help you find an advertising package that works for you.
        <br><br>
        Every quarter we distribute 1800-2000 free print issues around the UW-Madison campus for thousands of students and faculty to enjoy. Some locations include various engineering and non-engineering academic buildings, student dorms, student commons, libraries, and various local restaurants. In addition to nearly 600 paying subscribers worldwide, one copy of each issue is distributed to every high school in the state of Wisconsin.
        <br><br>
        Along with print issues, we recently began posting all of our articles (and web-only specials) onto our new website. We have staff members dedicated to promote our website across various social media outlets, making sure our readership continues to climb!
